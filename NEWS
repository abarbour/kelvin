kelvin 1.0-1 (2012-07-27) ----------------------------------------

* bug fix: scaling was inappropriately applied if nSeq>1, meaning that
 higher order functions would have incorrect sign. Checked consistency 
 in higher order terms with figures on Wolfram's site.

* A warning: This may not be a problem, especially since the developer of 
  Bessel is a core contributer (i.e. is aware of the conflict, and comfortable
  with it), but Importing Bessel overrides fundamental base::
  functions such as cbind, %*%, etc.  This worries me and I'll work on
  preventing collisions.
